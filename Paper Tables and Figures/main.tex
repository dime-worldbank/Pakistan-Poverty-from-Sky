Correlations are computed at the cluster level using the latest survey year for each country. {\bf Panel A} shows the distribution of within-country correlations of the feature with the highest median correlation across countries for each dataset. {\bf Panel B} shows the correlation of all variables from the Facebook marketing data. {\bf Panel C} shows select variables from OpenStreetMap data; the panel shows all variables of (1) the length of different classes of roads and (2) the number of different points of interests (POIs) near survey clusters. {\bf Panel D} shows the correlation of all pollution variables from Sentinel-5P and MODIS; AOD variables are from MODIS and the other variables are from Sentinel-5P.
